# Kamamana - Designed ReactJS Components

Not a Design Library, but a collection of HOC Components built using `styled-components`,
that will come handy for me to build up any website.

It's my handy collection of Component Library. Just for fun... :relaxed:

Can customize these components, after copying them to my separate projects.

This ia NOT a generic library, and is not thought properly to support a wide audience.

The Collection of each component can be viewed @ https://willofindie.github.io/kamamana
